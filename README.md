## Problem Statement
- Governments of countries in debt borrow money, mainly through issuing bonds. These bonds are sold to investors. 
- Associated with each bond there is an interest rate, which is paid periodically, with the principal paid after a certain number of years.
- However, some of these countries fail to pay back these loans, and go into Sovereign Default. This can cost bond holders billions of dollars.

- Bonds have an interest rate associated with them. The larger the probability of default, the the larger the interest rate is expected to be. 

- This is a model is designed to predict risk of sovereign default, by analyzing macroeconomic data.

This model tries to do things other Sovereign Risk models have not done. This is open source models, unlike other models on Sovereign Default. In contrast to other models, this project has a free web apps hosted on Heroku.
